I selected dataset Transactional Retail Dataset of Electronics Store where problem statement is to get analyses the root cause of the customer dissatisfaction.
Here I amchecking dissatisfactory of customer with every parameter of the dataset.
The solutions to the problem statement(s)
1.	Thompson had the highest dissatisfaction rate yet had the highest orders
2.	Final cause was found by finding all parameters and the main reason we found was lack of coupons issues in August, which lead to most dissatisfaction at Thompson.
3.	Thompson is the undisputed king of warehouse with most orders deliveries. 
4.	Customers tend to like more coupons; they are okay to pay delivery charges. 
5.	Keep giving coupons throughout the year, as people like discounts on order prices
